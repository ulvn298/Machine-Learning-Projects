Machine Learning Journey 🚀
This repository contains my practical implementations of Machine Learning projects as Iprogress through the Andrew Ng Machine Learning Specialization
[cite: 2026-01-06]. I am a student at Assiut National University, focusing on building real-world AI solutions [cite: 2026-01-06].

🛠 Projects Included:
Real Estate Price Prediction: Linear Regression model to estimate property values.

Credit Risk Classifier: Random Forest implementation for financial risk assessment.

Sentiment Analysis Engine: NLP tool using Naive Bayes to classify customer feedback.
